# Computer_Vision_Labs

This repository contains all of the labs completed for the CSE 185 Introduction
to Computer Vision course at the University of California, Merced. These were all
completed utilizing the MatLab computer vision library as instructed. In order to 
run the files the MatLab file named LabXX must be ran in a MatLab environment. Note
that some of these files were provided by the instructors as partially complete skeletons
which were then completed.
