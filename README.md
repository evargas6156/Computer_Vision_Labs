# Computer_Vision_Labs

This repository contains all of the labs completed for the CSE 185 Introduction to Computer Vision course at the University of California, Merced. These were all completed utilizing the MatLab computer vision library as instructed. In order to run the files the MatLab file named LabXX must be ran in a MatLab environment. Note that some of these files were provided by the instructors as partially complete skeletons which were then completed. Any input and output images as well as additional data needed for the files are provided.
